"""Parallel YOLOE + RelateAnything inference pipeline for batch-1 real time.

WHY THIS EXISTS (all numbers measured on the full-recipe checkpoint, A40, bf16):

  * batch-1 is CPU-DISPATCH bound, not compute bound: 1,362 kernel launches per
    image, ~30 ms of CPU dispatch against ~9 ms of GPU work. Proof: bs1 latency
    is identical at 448/392/336 px. So the classic moves (smaller backbone,
    lower resolution) buy nothing here — overlapping and shrinking the WORK
    GRAPH does.
  * `torch.compile`: "default" is 2.4x stream-stable (measured over 32 object
    counts); "reduce-overhead" (CUDA graphs) adds ~13 % on top with NO extra
    error beyond inductor's own — the earlier "silently wrong" reading was a
    tie-breaking measurement bug (see relsgg-inference-launch-bound). Either
    mode perturbs eval metrics ~40x the noise floor: demo/product only, never
    for reported numbers.

THE THREE OPTIMISATIONS IMPLEMENTED

 1. INTRA-FRAME OVERLAP ON A WORKER THREAD. The DINOv3 backbone does not
    depend on the boxes (`model.forward` uses `boxes` only from SoftSpatialPool
    onward), so the detector and the backbone are INDEPENDENT branches:

        frame ─┬─→ YOLOE-11m ────────→ boxes/masks ─┐
               └─→ DINOv3 backbone ──→ F_map ───────┴─→ SSP → … → triplets

    MEASURED, and the obvious implementation is the wrong one: a second CUDA
    STREAM alone buys nothing (22.6 ms sequential -> 22.7 ms), because both
    branches are CPU-dispatch bound and a stream does not add a CPU thread.
    Running the backbone on a worker THREAD, whose launches proceed while
    ultralytics holds the main thread, gives 22.6 -> 16.9 ms (-25%, i.e. 57%
    of the theoretical overlap). Joined via `precomputed_features`.

 2. RIGHT-SIZED STATIC SHAPES. With static shapes the head always pays for
    `max_objects` boxes and `final_budget` pairs no matter how many the
    detector returned — filtering to the top-k detections saves NOTHING unless
    the shapes shrink too. `PipelineConfig.max_objects/final_budget` shrink
    them to what a webcam scene actually contains. Candidate pairs go as N².

 3. CROSS-FRAME PIPELINING (optional, `pipelined=True`). A worker thread runs
    detector+backbone for frame N+1 while the main thread finishes the relation
    stage of frame N, so steady-state throughput becomes max(stage) instead of
    sum(stage). Costs one frame of latency. Works on CPU too, where there are
    no streams to overlap.

Both models stay re-parameterizable at runtime: `set_object_classes` (YOLOE
text prompts) and `set_predicates` (relation vocabulary via the checkpoint's
own text encoder).
